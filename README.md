## Setup

This assumes you have a src folder in your root directory, and inside src, you have a components folder (if not, will generate one for you).  
Presets are coming soon with multiple snippets to gen components more easily.

> npm install hcg  
or
> yarn add hcg  
I recommend creating a script inside your package.json like so:  
~~~ 
{
    "scripts": {
       "gen-comp": "node ./node_modules/hcg/index.js"  
   }  
}
~~~
